#### 2. **Network Conditions Testing**
- [ ] Test on Slow 3G network
- [ ] Test on Fast 3G network  
- [ ] Test on WiFi
- [ ] Test offline functionality

**How to test:**
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Set throttling to "Slow 3G"
4. Reload and test your app

#### 3. **Real User Monitoring Setup**
- [ ] Add performance monitoring to your app
- [ ] Import: `import { performanceMonitor } from './src/lib/utils/performanceMonitor.js'`
- [ ] Monitor for 1 week to collect real user data

### **Priority: MEDIUM** 🟡

#### 4. **Cross-Browser Testing**
- [ ] Test in Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Test in Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Test in Safari (latest)
- [ ] Test in Edge (latest)

#### 5. **Load Testing** 
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Test rapid map interactions (zoom, pan)
- [ ] Test location services under load
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during extended use

#### 6. **Bundle Analysis**
- [ ] Run bundle analyzer: `npm run analyze:bundle`
- [ ] Verify bundle size remains <500KB
- [ ] Check for unused code

### **Priority: LOW** 🟢

#### 7. **Progressive Web App Testing**
- [ ] Test offline map functionality
- [ ] Test service worker caching
- [ ] Test app installation flow

#### 8. **Accessibility Testing**
- [ ] Test with screen reader
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test color contrast
- [ ] Test with high contrast mode

## 🛠 **QUICK TESTING COMMANDS**

```bash
# Complete performance test suite
npm run test:performance

# Quick lighthouse audit
npm run test:lighthouse

# Mobile-specific testing
npm run test:mobile

# Bundle size analysis
npm run analyze:bundle

# Local testing server
npm run serve:local
```

## 📊 **PERFORMANCE TARGETS TO MAINTAIN**

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Desktop Performance** | 93/100 | ≥90 | ✅ Excellent |
| **Mobile Performance** | TBD | ≥80 | 🔍 Test Required |
| **Accessibility** | 100/100 | ≥95 | ✅ Perfect |
| **Best Practices** | 95/100 | ≥90 | ✅ Excellent |
| **Bundle Size** | ~61KB | <500KB | ✅ Excellent |
| **LCP** | 0.6s | <2.5s | ✅ Outstanding |
| **TBT** | 200ms | <300ms | ✅ Excellent |
| **CLS** | 0 | <0.1 | ✅ Perfect |

## 🚨 **REGRESSION MONITORING**

Set up alerts if any metric drops below:
- Performance Score: <85
- Accessibility: <95  
- LCP: >2.5s
- TBT: >300ms
- Bundle Size: >500KB

## 💡 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **This Week**: Run mobile performance test
2. **This Month**: Set up real user monitoring  
3. **Ongoing**: Monthly Lighthouse audits
4. **As Needed**: Cross-browser testing before releases
